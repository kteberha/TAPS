Bad news, Zip.

Looks like a black hole formed near one of your customer's houses. None of our radars picked it up until after it was already there.

Thankfully the customer is still there. Their home is equipped with space stablizers so they're sitting comfy, ready and waiting for their plant orders.

Yes you still have to deliver packages to 'em. Don't worry. If you get sucked in, your teleporter device will pull you right out safe and sound.

So hop to it!
