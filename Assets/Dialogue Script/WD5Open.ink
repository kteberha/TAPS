Welp. Looks like you can't catch a break, Zip.

Despite the debris and black hole, someone else decided to move into the area. The questionnaire she filled out says she's a doctor looking to use TAPS plants for medical research.

Also says here she's admittedly not that patient so she'll be wanting her deliveries quicker. However, she notes she's very rewarding if those demands are met.

Well, whatever. I'm sure you'll be fine. You've been doing well so far.

Light speed, Zip!
