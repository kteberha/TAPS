Morning, Zip, though I'm not sure it's a good one.

I had a bad feeling about this a few days ago, but didn't want to say anything so not to worry you.

Looks like that black hole pulled a bunch of stars into your quadrant. They shouldn't be too problematic.

In fact, they will certainly give you a bit of a boost in a pinch, but proceed with caution: they have a chance of becoming a black hole afterward. 

Good luck, Zip! See you after your shift.
