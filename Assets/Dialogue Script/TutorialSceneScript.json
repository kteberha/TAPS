{"inkVersion":19,"root":[["^Alright so we've assigned you to our Omega quadrant route.","\n","^It's pretty deserted. So if you screw up, you won't hurt our reputation too much.","\n","^We've equipped you with a company standard space propulsion device and no! It is not the fire extinguisher from the front office so don't ask.","\n","^Go ahead and give it a whirl. You can hold down the controls for gliding movement or tap 'em to give you more control.","\n","^Good job. You've mastered pushing a button. Now here's the real job.","\n","^Throughout the workday, you'll receive customer orders. When you get an order, a customer's portrait icon will pop up on your screen. Perks of being a robot on this job.","\n","^Customers can order one of three packages containing valuable plants. You don't need to know what's in 'em. You just worry about delivering them.","\n","^You'll find the packages in the Shipping Lane, the giant blue donut in the middle of the sector. Packages get teleported there from our delivery hub.","\n","^Find the packages you need to complete the customer's order and run into them. The collision will automatically activate your inventory tractor beam tool.","\n","^Try grabbing one.","\n","^Well done. Now grab a few more.","\n","^Ok that's enough lollygagging. It looks like you've got your first order.","\n","^Start heading toward your customer's home and move fast! We've got a reputation to uphold!","\n","^You have to deliver the package before the customer's expected time for delivery is up, or the order gets cancelled entirely. So get a move on!","\n","^Use the customer's directional indicator to navigate your way to their home.","\n","^Despite the area being mostly deserted, you will encounter a few obstacles. They are not an excuse to be late for delivery! So get around them by any means necessary and get those packages delivered.","\n","^Good job avoiding those obstacles. We might just make a courier of you yet.","\n","^Now that you've arrived at the customer's home, all that’s left is to deliver the right package. You can cycle through your inventory tractor beam to select the correct package.","\n","^When you're ready, chuck the package at the customer's home or asteroid to complete the delivery.","\n","^Well done. Oh! It looks like a few more orders came in.","\n","^Get on those orders pronto! Activate your teleporter to return to the Shipping Lane.","\n","^You can use the teleporter to get out of a tight spot, but be warned: Your packages do not travel with you. And those packages left behind will be coming out of your paycheck.","\n","^That about sums up your training. I'll see you after your workday ends.","\n","^If you ever don't know what to do, remember management’s motto: Our employees are expendable. Our high-quality customer service is not.","\n","done",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
