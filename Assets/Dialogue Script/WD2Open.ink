Well Zip, you've gone and done it.

Your wrecklessness yesterday caused a whole mess in the quadrant! Those asteroids you ran into yesterday shattered and broke off into smaller pieces.

The quadrant is a mess with debris. This is your fault and you better not let it slow down your work or you can kiss your job goodbye.

Now get to work!
