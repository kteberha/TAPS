I've got some good news, Zip!

Nothing changed in the quadrant over night. Nothing got better either, BUT your route hasn't changed! So you'll at least know the layout a bit.

I won't lie to you though. Our radars are picking up something odd in the area just outside your quadrant.

We can't confirm what it is yet, but hopefully it doesn't get any closer. I'll keep you posted if I hear anything else.

See you in a bit, Zip!
